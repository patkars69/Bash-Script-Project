# **Multi-OS Monitor**
Problem - User needs to login to specific Operating Systems (in Virtual Machines) like CentOS , Ubuntu separately to monitor the health checks and wellbeing of the application running over the VMs with different set of commands (unique as per OS).

Solution - Created a Bash Script both manually and with the help of ChatGPT in order to store the specific commands as per the exit codesfor specific Operating Systems.
The user is now able to access all the connected Operating Systems (in Virtual Machines) remotely with the help of SSH key exchange and Remote command execution without even logging in to the specific Operating systems.
